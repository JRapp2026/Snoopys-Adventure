            <h2>Background and Family</h2>
            <p>Introduced in the Peanuts comic strip on October 4, 1950, Snoopy quickly became a central character. He was born at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm and adopted by Charlie Brown, becoming an integral part of the Peanuts gang. Despite being a dog, Snoopy has a rich inner life filled with elaborate fantasies and complex personality traits.</p>
            
            <h2>Early Influences</h2>
            <p>From the beginning, Snoopy showed remarkable creativity and imagination. Unlike typical dogs, he walks on two legs, has a vivid fantasy life, and communicates through thought bubbles. His iconic red doghouse became a symbol of his unique character, serving as everything from a home to a fighter plane in his imaginative scenarios.</p>
